### Lesson 9
# Adding Media

We browse the Internet in search of interesting and informative content, which we usually find in the form of plain text. To accompany this plain text, HTML provides ways to embed rich media in the form of images, audio tracks, and videos, as well as to embed content from another web page in the form of an inline frame.

The ability to include images, audio tracks, videos, and inline frames within websites has been around for some time. Browser support for images and inline frames has generally been pretty good. And while the ability to add audio tracks and videos to a website has been around for years, the process has been fairly cumbersome. Fortunately, this process has improved and is much easier with support directly from HTML.

Today, we can freely use images, audio, video, and inline frames knowing that this content is supported across all major browsers.

###Adding Images
To add images to a page, we use the **img** inline element. The **img** element is a self-containing, or empty, element, which means that it doesnâ€™t wrap any other content and it exists as a single tag. For the **img** element to work, a src attribute and value must be included to specify the source of the image. The src attribute value is a URL, typically relative to the server where a website is hosted.

In conjunction with the src attribute, the alt (alternative text) attribute, which describes the contents of an image, should be applied. The alt attribute value is picked up by search engines and assistive technologies to help convey the purpose of an image. The alt text will be displayed in place of the image if for some reason the image is not available.
